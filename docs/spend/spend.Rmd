*Note: The FYFVMH dashboard and MHS dataset only presents data for children’s mental health services directly commissioned by the NHS. As such, this report does not examine figures on low-level mental health provision such as school-based counselling or services provided by external organisations (services which may be funded by the NHS but not considered NHS commissioned).*

Overall, CCG spending on mental health has continued to increase over the past two years. Of the total NHS spend for England (£82 billion), CCGs spent £881 million on children’s mental health services (1.1% of total allocation). This compares to £791 million in 2019/20 (0.97% of total allocation) – an increase of 11% in cash and 4.4% in real terms . Spend per child has also increased, up from £66 in 2019/20 to £73 in 2020/21. This represents an increase of 9.6% in cash terms and a 3.7% increase in real terms. 

* The top 20% of CCGs with the highest spend per child in 2019/20 have an average increase in spend per child of £4 from 2019/20 to 2020/21. This is compared to the bottom 20% of CCGs which have an average increase in spend per child of £9 in cash terms. This suggests that spending has increased across the board, especially in CCGs that invested the least last year.
* Out of 135 CCGs in England, most (82% - 111) increased spending on CYPMHS per child from 2019/20 to 2020/21. This compares to 83% of CCGs that increased CYPMHS spending the previous year. However, there remain 24 CCGs (18%) that reduced CYPMHS spending between 2019/20 and 2020/21. Of these, 5 CCGs reduced spend per child for two consecutive years.

*Note: Above changes in mental health spending are in cash terms unless otherwise stated.*
